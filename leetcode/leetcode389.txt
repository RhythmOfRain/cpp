Example:

Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.

my solution:
class Solution {
public:
    char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
        vector<int> cnt(26, 0);
        for(auto c : s)
            ++cnt[c - 'a'];
        for(auto c : t){
            if(--cnt[c - 'a'] < 0)
                return c;
        }
        return ' ';
    }
};
