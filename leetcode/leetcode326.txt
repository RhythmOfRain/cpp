Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of three.

Follow up:
Could you do it without using any loop / recursion?

my solution:
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPowerOfThree(int n) {
        // 1162261467 is 3^19,  3^20 is bigger than int  
        return n>0 && 1162261467 % n==0;
    }
};
