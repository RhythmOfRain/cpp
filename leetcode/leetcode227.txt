Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string.

The expression string contains only non-negative integers, +, -, *, / operators and empty spaces . The integer division should truncate toward zero.

You may assume that the given expression is always valid.

Some examples:
"3+2*2" = 7
" 3/2 " = 1
" 3+5 / 2 " = 5
Note: Do not use the eval built-in library function.

my solution:
class Solution {
public:
    int calculate(string s) {
    istringstream in('+' + s + '+');
    long long total = 0, term = 0, n;
    char op;
    while (in >> op) {
        if (op == '+' || op == '-') {
            total += term;
            in >> term;
            //term *= 44 - op;
	    term *= op == '+' ? 1 : -1;
        } else {
            in >> n;
            if (op == '*')
                term *= n;
            else
                term /= n;
        }
    }
    return total;
    }
};
