A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

my solution:
class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        vector<int> vi(n, 1);
        for(int i = 1; i < m; ++i)
            for(int j = 1; j < n; ++j)
                vi[j] += vi[j - 1];
        return vi[n-1];
    }
};
