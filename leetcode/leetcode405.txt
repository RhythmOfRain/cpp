Given an integer, write an algorithm to convert it to hexadecimal. For negative integer, two¡¯s complement method is used.

Note:

All letters in hexadecimal (a-f) must be in lowercase.
The hexadecimal string must not contain extra leading 0s. If the number is zero, it is represented by a single zero character '0'; otherwise, the first character in the hexadecimal string will not be the zero character.
The given number is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
You must not use any method provided by the library which converts/formats the number to hex directly.
Example 1:

Input:
26

Output:
"1a"
Example 2:

Input:
-1

Output:
"ffffffff"


my solution:
class Solution {
public:
    string toHex(int num) {
        if(num == 0)
            return "0";
        string dict = "0123456789abcdef";
        string res;
        int cnt = 0;
        while(num && cnt < 8){
            res = dict[num & 15] + res;
            num >>= 4;
            ++cnt;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
