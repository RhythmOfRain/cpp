136. Single Number

Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

my solution:
class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int res = 0;
        size_t len = nums.size();
        for(size_t i = 0; i < len; ++i)
            res ^= nums[i];
        return res;
    }
};
