Rotate an array of n elements to the right by k steps.

For example, with n = 7 and k = 3, the array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is rotated to [5,6,7,1,2,3,4].

Note:
Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.

class Solution {
public:
    void rotate(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int size = nums.size();
        k %= size;
        if(k == 0)
            return ;
        change(nums, 0, size - k - 1);
        change(nums, size - k, size - 1);
        change(nums, 0, size - 1);
    }
    
private:    
    void change(vector<int>& nums, int i, int j){
        while(i < j){
            int temp = nums[i];
            nums[i] = nums[j];
            nums[j] = temp;
            ++i;
            --j;
        }
    }
